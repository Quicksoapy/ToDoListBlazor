# ToDoList Blazor

ToDoListBlazor is a todo-list made in blazor to learn ASP.NET Core.

## Installation

Currently, there is no version made for use. You can compile it and set up a database for it yourself. I personally used postgres in a docker client.

## Usage

Up top, there is a form to enter a name and description, there you can add a task. 

For each task, there is a 'Done' and 'Delete' button, for updating the table that that specific task is done and to delete that task.
